<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive HVAC Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive HVAC dampers are divided into two main types based on actuation methods. Non-spring return damper actuators control airflow in the HVAC system without the use of springs, providing accurate and reliable operation. On the other hand, spring return damper actuators use a spring mechanism to return the damper to its default position when the actuator is not powered, ensuring safety and efficiency in HVAC systems. Both types play crucial roles in controlling air distribution and temperature in automotive HVAC systems.</p></p>
