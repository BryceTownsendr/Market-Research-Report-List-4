<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Lathe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Lathe</li><li>Vertical Lathe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic lathes are commonly divided into two main types in the market - horizontal lathes and vertical lathes. Horizontal lathes are designed with the spindle mounted horizontally and the workpiece positioned parallel to the ground, making them suitable for machining long, cylindrical parts. On the other hand, vertical lathes feature a vertically mounted spindle, allowing for easier chip removal and better stability when working on large, heavy parts. Both types of automatic lathes offer unique advantages and are used in a variety of industries for precision machining purposes.</p></p>
