<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Linear Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axle Type</li><li>Shaft Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive linear encoders come in two main types: axle type and shaft type. Axle type encoders are mounted directly onto the moving part of a machine, such as a motor or conveyor belt, and measure linear motion along an axle. Shaft type encoders, on the other hand, are installed on a rotating shaft to measure linear displacement. Both types of encoders use capacitive technology to accurately detect the position of the moving part, making them ideal for industrial applications requiring high precision and reliability.</p></p>
