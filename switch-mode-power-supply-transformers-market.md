<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Switch Mode Power Supply Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-excited</li><li>Double-excited</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Switch Mode Power Supply Transformers are classified into two main types: Single-excited and Double-excited transformers. </p><p>In Single-excited transformers, the primary winding is excited by only one control switch, resulting in a simpler design and lower cost. On the other hand, Double-excited transformers have two control switches that alternate excitation between primary and secondary windings, allowing for a more efficient power conversion process. Double-excited transformers are often used in applications where higher power output and better regulation are required.</p></p>
