<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IR Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact IR Temperature Sensor</li><li>Non-contact IR Temperature Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IR temperature sensors are used for measuring temperature without direct contact with the object. Contact IR temperature sensors require physical contact with the object being measured, making them suitable for surfaces that are accessible. On the other hand, non-contact IR temperature sensors can measure temperature from a distance, making them ideal for measuring moving objects or surfaces that are hard to reach. Both types of sensors are widely used in various industries such as automotive, manufacturing, and healthcare for precise temperature measurement.</p></p>
