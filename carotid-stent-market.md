<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTA</li><li>CAS</li><li>CEA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carotid stent market includes three main types of procedures - percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), carotid artery stenting (CAS), and carotid endarterectomy (CEA). PTA involves inserting and inflating a small balloon in the affected artery to widen it and improve blood flow. CAS is a minimally invasive procedure where a stent is placed in the carotid artery to keep it open and prevent blockages. CEA is a surgical procedure in which the blocked artery is opened and plaque is removed to restore proper blood flow.</p></p>
