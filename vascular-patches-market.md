<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biologic Vascular Patches</li><li>Synthetic Vascular Patches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular patches are used in surgeries to repair blood vessels and are classified into two main types: biologic vascular patches and synthetic vascular patches. Biologic vascular patches are made from natural materials such as bovine pericardium or human umbilical veins, providing a more natural tissue match and potential for faster healing. Synthetic vascular patches, on the other hand, are created from materials like Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), offering increased durability and resistance to infection. Both types play crucial roles in vascular surgeries, each with unique benefits.</p></p>
