<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stress Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blind Hole Method</li><li>Ring Core Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stress gauge market can be categorized into two main types: the blind hole method and the ring core method. The blind hole method involves drilling a hole into the material where the stress needs to be measured, allowing the gauge to directly sense the stress in that specific location. On the other hand, the ring core method uses a ring-shaped core that is placed around the material to measure the stress across a larger surface area. Both methods have their own advantages and are used in various industries for stress measurement applications.</p></p>
