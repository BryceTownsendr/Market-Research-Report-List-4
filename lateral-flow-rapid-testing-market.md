<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Rapid Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Immunoassay</li><li>Competitive Immunoassay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lateral Flow Rapid Testing is commonly categorized into two main market types: Sandwich Immunoassay and Competitive Immunoassay. Sandwich immunoassay involves the use of two antibodies that bind to different epitopes on the target antigen, resulting in a sandwich-like complex. On the other hand, competitive immunoassay involves competition between the target antigen and a labeled antigen for binding sites on a limited number of antibodies. Both types of assays are used in various applications including medical diagnostics, food safety testing, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
