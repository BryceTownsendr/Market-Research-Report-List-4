<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AGV Mobile Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With SLAM</li><li>Without SLAM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AGV Mobile Robot market can be categorized into two types based on their navigation system: with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and without SLAM. AGVs with SLAM technology use advanced algorithms to create a map of their environment while simultaneously pinpointing their location within that map. This allows for more efficient and flexible navigation. On the other hand, AGVs without SLAM rely on pre-defined routes or markers for navigation, which may limit their adaptability in changing environments.</p></p>
