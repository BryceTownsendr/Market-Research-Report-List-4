<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bile Duct Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Type</li><li>Uncovered Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bile duct stents are divided into two types: covered and uncovered. Covered stents are designed with a sleeve to prevent tumor ingrowth or bile leakage. These stents are ideal for patients with strictures or blockages. Uncovered stents, on the other hand, do not have a sleeve and are suitable for patients with benign strictures or those who require long-term stent placement. Both types of stents are used in the treatment of biliary obstructions, but the choice between covered and uncovered stents depends on the individual patient's condition.</p></p>
