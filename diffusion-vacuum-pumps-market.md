<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffusion Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Diffusion Pumps</li><li>Vapor Jet Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffusion vacuum pumps are categorized into two main types: oil diffusion pumps and vapor jet pumps. Oil diffusion pumps operate by heating oil to create vapor that pushes gas molecules out of the system. On the other hand, vapor jet pumps use a high-speed jet of vapor to create a vacuum by entraining gas molecules and ejecting them from the system. Both types of diffusion vacuum pumps are widely used in various industrial applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, aerospace, and research laboratories for achieving high vacuum levels.</p></p>
