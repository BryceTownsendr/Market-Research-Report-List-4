<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mist Eliminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wire-mesh Mist Eliminators</li><li>Baffle-type Mist Climinators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wire-mesh mist eliminators are made of layers of mesh that capture mist droplets as gas passes through. These are commonly used in industries such as petrochemical and chemical processing. Baffle-type mist eliminators use a series of plates or vanes to redirect the flow of gas, causing mist droplets to collide with the surface and be removed. Both types of mist eliminators are effective in removing liquid particles from gas streams, improving overall air quality and efficiency in industrial processes.</p></p>
