<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Fabrication Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent</li><li>Relocatable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permanent modular fabrication refers to structures that are built to stay in one location indefinitely. These structures are typically larger and more complex, with foundations and services permanently attached to the site.</p><p>Relocatable modular fabrication, on the other hand, can be easily disassembled and moved to a new location. These structures are often smaller and simpler, making them more adaptable for temporary or changing needs. Relocatable modular fabrication offers the flexibility to adjust to evolving requirements without the need for a complete rebuild.</p></p>
