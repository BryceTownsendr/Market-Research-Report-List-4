<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvic Compression Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locked</li><li>Unlocked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Locked and unlocked pelvic compression plates are two types of devices used in orthopedic surgery to stabilize fractures in the pelvis. Locked plates have screw holes that are designed to be fixed in a specific position, providing a more stable construct. Unlocked plates, on the other hand, allow for more flexibility in screw placement, which may be beneficial in certain cases where the anatomy is complex or the fracture pattern requires greater adjustability. Surgeons must consider the specific needs of each patient when choosing between locked and unlocked pelvic compression plates.</p></p>
