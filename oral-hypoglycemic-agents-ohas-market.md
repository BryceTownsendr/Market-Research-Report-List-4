<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfonylureas</li><li>Metformin</li><li>Thiazolidinediones</li><li>Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs) are medications used to lower blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. The market for OHAs can be categorized into four main types: Sulfonylureas, Metformin, Thiazolidinediones, and Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors. Sulfonylureas work by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin, Metformin decreases glucose production in the liver, Thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells, and Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors slow down the absorption of carbohydrates in the intestines. These medications play a crucial role in managing diabetes and preventing complications.</p></p>
