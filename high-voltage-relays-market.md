<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact High Voltage Relays</li><li>No-Contact High Voltage Relays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Voltage Relays are classified into two main types: Contact High Voltage Relays and No-Contact High Voltage Relays. Contact High Voltage Relays operate by physically touching electrodes to complete the circuit, making direct contact with high voltage components. On the other hand, No-Contact High Voltage Relays operate without direct physical contact, using techniques such as magnetic fields or optical sensors to control the flow of high voltage. Both types of relays are essential components in electrical systems for safely controlling high voltage currents.</p></p>
